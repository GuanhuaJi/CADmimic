  "good": [
    "The overall shape and proportions of the tongs are generally correct.",
    "The model correctly includes the two handle inserts.",
    "The model features the circular ring at the hinge end.",

  ],
  "bad": [
    "The gripping ends of the tongs are completely incorrect; they are flat and straight in the model, but should be curved with a scalloped edge.",
    "The arms of the tongs are modeled as perfectly straight, whereas the real object has a slight bend or curvature along its length.",
    "The handle inserts are modeled as simple rectangular blocks with sharp edges, but the real ones have rounded, more ergonomic edges.",
    "The model lacks the detail of the locking mechanism associated with the rear ring.",
    "The metal components are too thin and lack the stamped U-channel shape that gives them rigidity in the real object.",
    "The pivot is a simple cylinder, missing the details of the rivet used in the actual tongs."
