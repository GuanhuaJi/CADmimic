  "good": [
    "The overall length and top-down silhouette are generally correct.",
    "The model correctly includes rectangular blocks to represent the wooden handle grips."
  ],
  "bad": [
    "The model is fundamentally incorrect as it consists of two separate, disconnected parts. The crucial hinge mechanism that joins the two arms is completely missing.",
    "The circular ring used for hanging the tongs is not modeled at the end of the handle.",
    "The scalloped, gripping tips of the tongs are poorly represented as a simple, smooth flare.",
    "The cross-section of the metal arms is wrong; it appears to be flat instead of having the correct U-shaped channel to hold the wooden inserts.",
    "The side views (front and back) show two separate pieces, which is not how the object is constructed.",
    "The wooden handle inserts appear to be floating on top of the metal rather than being properly inset."
