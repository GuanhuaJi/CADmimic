  "good": [
    "The overall 2D profile and proportions of the tongs from the top view are accurate.",
    "The scalloped shape of the tips is correctly captured in the silhouette.",
    "The model includes the hinge pivot and the hanging ring at the end.",
    "The wooden grips are present and in the correct general location on the handles."
  ],
  "bad": [
    "The model is completely flat and lacks the three-dimensional form of the real object. The arms should be made of bent sheet metal, forming a U-channel.",
    "The wooden grips are modeled as thin, flat rectangles, not as the shaped wooden blocks seen in the video.",
    "The tips of the tongs are flat in the model, but they should have a slight concave, spoon-like curve.",
    "The internal spring mechanism that pushes the tongs apart is not modeled.",
    "The arms in the model are perfectly straight, while the real tongs have a slight curve along their length."
