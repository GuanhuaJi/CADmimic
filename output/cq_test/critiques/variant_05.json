{
  "good": [
    "The model correctly represents the object as having two long arms.",
    "The overall V-shape of the open tongs is captured from the front and back views.",
    "A ring-like feature is present at the hinge end, similar to the real object's hanging loop."
  ],
  "bad": [
    "The top and bottom views are completely incorrect, showing a single solid bar instead of two separate arms with a space between them.",
    "The tips of the tongs are wrong; the model has flat ends, while the real object has scalloped, curved tips for gripping.",
    "The hinge mechanism is inaccurate. The model shows a simple circular joint, not the riveted pivot seen in the video.",
    "The wooden grips are poorly represented as just thicker parts of the arms, rather than distinct attached pieces.",
    "The overall shape is too blocky and lacks the specific curves and thinness of the real metal tongs."
