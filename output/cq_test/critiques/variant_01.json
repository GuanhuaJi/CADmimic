  "good": [
    "The overall shape and proportions of the tongs are correct.",
    "The model includes the scalloped ends for gripping food.",
    "The presence and location of the wooden handle grips are accurate.",
    "A hanging ring is correctly included at the end of one of the handles."
  ],
  "bad": [
    "The model completely omits the spring mechanism located between the handles near the pivot point.",
    "The metal handles are incorrectly modeled as simple flat plates, whereas the real object has handles formed from bent sheet metal into a C-channel shape.",
    "The wooden grips are modeled as simple blocks attached to the outside of the metal, not as inlays that sit inside the metal channel.",
    "The model lacks realistic thickness and appears as a flat 2D extrusion, especially evident in the front and side views.",
    "The pivot point is overly simplified and doesn't accurately represent the rivet construction of the actual tongs."
